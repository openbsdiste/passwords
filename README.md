Password handler over differents subodmains

To be able to use CPanel webmail passwords handler, you must create subfolder backend/handler/CPanel
and use composer (for example) to get the gufy/cpanel-whm plugin :

        composer require gufy/cpanel-whm:dev-master

This "application" requires jQuery, which is included.

Have a nice day !
