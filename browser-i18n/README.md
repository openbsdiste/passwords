browser-i18n
============

Simple tool for i18n in the browser, inspired by 
[mashpie/i18n-node](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node) and 
[jeresig/i18n-node-2](https://github.com/jeresig/i18n-node-2), 
with the difference that this script is browser only (not a node.js module).

### Usage

```html
<script src="/i18n.js"></script>
<script>
  //Will make a request to /locales/en.json and then cache the results
  var i18n = new I18n({
    //these are the default values, you can omit
    directory: "/locales",
    locale: "en",
    extension: ".json"
  });  
  
  console.log(i18n.__("Hello")); //Hello
  console.log(i18n.__("Hello %s", "Foo")); //Hello Foo
  console.log(i18n.__n("%s cat", 0)) //no cats
  console.log(i18n.__n("%s cat", 1)) //1 cat
  console.log(i18n.__n("%s cat", 2)) //2 cats
  
  //You can change locale at any time by issuing `setLocale`
  //Another request is made in order to load /locales/de.json
  i18n.setLocale("de");
  
  console.log(i18n.__("Hello")); //Hallo
  console.log(i18n.__("Hello %s", "Foo")); //Hallo Foo
  console.log(i18n.__n("%s cat", 0)) //keine Katzen
  console.log(i18n.__n("%s cat", 1)) //1 Katze
  console.log(i18n.__n("%s cat", 2)) //2 Katzen
</script>
```

If you don't provide a locale at instantiation browser-i18n will first try 
to get locale information from html's lang tag (`<html lang="locale">...</html>`) in case 
it is not defined locale value will fallback to `en` automatically.

#### Locale Files

You will have to create a separate locale file for each language. Locale files should look like this:  

**/locales/en.json**
```json
{
  "Hello": "Hello",
  "Hello %s": "Hello %s",
  "%s cat": {
  	"zero": "no cats",
    "one": "%s cat",
    "other": "%s cats"
  }
}
```

**/locales/de.json**
```json
{
  "Hello": "Hallo",
  "Hello %s": "Hallo %s",
  "%s cat": {
  	"zero": "keine Katzen",
    "one": "%s Katze",
    "other": "%s Katzen"
  }
}
```

Mind that you can use [Sprintf](https://github.com/alexei/sprintf.js) syntax in your locale files
so don't forget checking their documentation to get the most out of browser-i18n.
